                The film was a co-production of DreamWorks and Warner Bros. in association with Arnold Leibovit Entertainment, who obtained the rights to the 1960 film adaptation of The Time Machine and collectively negotiated the deal that made it possible for both DreamWorks and Warner Bros. to make the movie. Leibovit was interested in making a new film since the 1980s.[4]
                Steven Spielberg was originally set to direct, but moved on to other projects. Then, Brad Silberling took over, but left over creative differences.[5] Simon Wells, who had been directing animated films for Spielberg since An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, was interested in getting into live-action, so he went to Jeffrey Katzenberg saying, "I really ought to be directing this because, you know, the name!"[6] Despite having never directed a live-action movie before, producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald recognized that because of Wells' animation background, the extensive visual effects work on the film would not be difficult for him to handle.[7]
                Director Gore Verbinski was brought in to take over the last 18 days of shooting, as Wells was suffering from "extreme exhaustion." Wells returned for post-production.[8] Filming began in February 2001 and finished on May 29, 2001.[9]

                   <p> George Pal was already known for his pioneering work with stop-motion animation, having been nominated almost yearly for an Oscar during the 1940s. In 1958, Pal was approached by Shiro Kido to co-produce a Japanese adaptation of the novel with Shochiku Productions.[6] After Kido left the project and Pal was unable to sell Hollywood on the concept of the film, he found MGM's British studio (where he had filmed Tom Thumb) open to his proposal.[citation needed]

                    The name of the film's main character (alluded to in dialogue only as "George") connects him both with George Pal and with the story's original science fiction writer H. G. (George) Wells. The name "H. George Wells" can be seen on a brass plaque on the time machine.[7] The film was created on a tight budget and given a filming schedule of just 29 days.[8]
                  </p>  The time machine prop was designed by MGM art director Bill Ferrari and built by Wah Chang.[11] Recognized today as an iconic film property, Ferrari's machine suggested a sled made up of a large clockwork rotating disk. The disk rotated at various speeds to indicate movement through time, evoking both a spinning clock and a solar disk.[citation needed] In a meta-concept touch, a brass plate on the time machine's instrument display panel identifies its inventor as "H. George Wells", though the Time Traveler is identified only as "George" in dialogue.[7] In Wells' original story, the protagonist is referred to only as the "Time Traveler".

                 <p>  As a means to cut costs, the dome habitat of the Eloi was constructed without a ceiling so that natural light could be used instead of costly artificial lighting.[12]

                    The look of the Morlocks was designed by Wah Chang.

                    With a budget of under $1 million, the film could not be shot on location in London. Live-action scenes were filmed from May 25 to June 30, 1959, in Culver City, California, with the backgrounds often filled in with matte paintings and models.[citation needed] Some of the costumes and props were re-used from Forbidden Planet (1956), such as the Civil Defence air raid officer uniform, which was the C-57-D crew uniform, and the large acrylic sphere in the talking rings room, a prop from the C-57-D's control bridge.

                    </p>In scenes where lava is shown to overrun the streets of London onto a miniature replica set, oatmeal was used as a substitute. The oatmeal had been prepared several days prior and left over a weekend, where it fermented in high temperatures, creating a "foul stench" in the air when it was released.[12]
