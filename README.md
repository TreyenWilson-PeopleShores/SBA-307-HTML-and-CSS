# SBA-307-HTML-and-CSS

I created the 3 pages for this. Each HTML page depends on the same main.css page. All HTML pages can be navigated to from each other. The images are inside the imgs folder, the HTML files are inside the html foler, and the CSS they all use is contained within a single file inside the css folder.
